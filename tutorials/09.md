## Overview
Generative AI is at the center of many heated debates across almost every domain, especially within the art world. There are many concerns about the training and/or input data used to power these models and whether creators' consent is involved. While some individuals consider AI to replace human creators altogether, many others think of AI as an additional tool which aids in creation. 

## Over 150 Generative Art Tools
The OpenTools website has curated a [list of over 150 generative art tools](https://opentools.ai/category/generative-art) which are currently available. Each may have different pricing models or availability. 

## Don't Expect Too Much
As enticing as it may sound to generate dozens of "new" designs on the fly based on input text, there are considerable limitations of generative art tools. The end result is not always what a user has in mind and is typically difficult to customize. Each software has made its own stylistic assumptions which derive from the body of data available for training each model. Many AI art tools have trouble correctly spelling the exact input text or accurately depicting human hands. The current reality is that these tools cannot directly replace the talent and expertise of trained scientfic and medicall illustrators.

## Potential Uses Cases in Science
* Personalized Lab Logos
* Graphical Abstracts for Research Papers
* Conceptual Icons for Slideshows
* Badges for Github Repositories
* Stickers to Advertise Your Projects

## DALL-E vs. Adobe Firefly
Below are two browser-accessible generative art applications. Here, we showcase the output differences when given the same prompt: 

### Prompt Given
![Art prompt](/assets/images/09-prompt.png)
> Alt Text: Image with light blue background with the following text printed, Cute cartoon logo with immune cells, bacteria, pathogens, and sparkles floating around a laptop showing the text: “AI 4 IMMUNO”

### DALL-E via Bing Create, [bing.com/images/create](bing.com/images/create)

This option is currently free to use and appears to have a token limit, which "boosts" the speed of image generation for each query.

### Adobe Firefly, [firefly.adobe.com/](firefly.adobe.com/)

This option requires having a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud.

## AI Artists to Follow
Countless artists have been creating generative AI art for years before the release of widely available software to the public. Artworks made with AI have reached one of the highest levels of exhibition in the art world, New York's Museum of Modern Art.
