## Overview
Generative AI is at the center of many heated debates across almost every domain, especially within the art world. There are many concerns about the training and/or input data used to power these models and whether creators' consent is involved. While some individuals consider AI to replace human creators altogether, many others think of AI as an additional tool which aids in creation. 

## Don't Expect Too Much
As enticing as it may sound to generate dozens of "new" designs on the fly based on input text, there are considerable limitations of generative art tools. The end result is not always what a user has in mind and is typically difficult to customize. Each software has made its own stylistic assumptions which derive from the body of data available for training each model. Many AI art tools have trouble correctly spelling the exact input text. None of these tools will ever directly replace the talent and expertise of trained scientfic and medicall illustrators.

## Potential Uses Cases in Science
* Lab Logos
* Graphical Abstracts for Research Papers
* Conceptual Icons for Slideshows
* Badges for Github Repositories
* Stickers to Advertise Your Projects

## Generative Art Tools
Below are two browser-accessible generative art applications. Here, we showcase the output differences when given the same prompt: 

### Prompt Given

### DALL-E via Bing Create, [bing.com/images/create](bing.com/images/create)
<br>This option is currently free to use and appears to have a token limit, which "boosts" the speed of image generation for each query.

## Over 150 Generative Art Tools
<br>The OpenTools website has curated a [list of over 150 generative art tools](https://opentools.ai/category/generative-art) which are currently available. Each may have different pricing models or availability. 


## AI Artists and Creators
Countless artists have been creating generative AI art for years before the release of widely available software to the public. Artworks made with AI have reached one of the highest levels of exhibition in the art world, New York's Museum of Modern Art.
