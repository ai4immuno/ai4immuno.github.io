## Data Preprocessing Tasks
ChatGPT can be a valuable integration into existing data science workflows. Data cleaning and preprocessing are often very time-consuming steps for any big analysis projects. Luckily, a [tutorial on KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/08/harnessing-chatgpt-automated-data-cleaning-preprocessing.html) outlines how to use ChatGPT to help with a few tasks. Check out the site for step-by-step prompt and code examples. 
* Fetch and load the dataset
* Check for missing values
* Encode categorical variables
* Visualizing the values of categorical variables
* Visualizing the distribution of class labels
* Tying it all together into a data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline

## Guide to Using ChatGPT for Data Science Projects
If you're curious how to take it even further in an end-to-end data science project, check out this [datacamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/chatgpt-data-science-projects). The following steps are covered with example pictures and code:
* Project planning
* Data analysis
* Data preprocessing
* Model selection
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Developing a web app
* Deploying it


## Translating Code
[One user on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/mrdbourke/status/1701461654926750024?t=I49raqM9QHZ2sRGfNDCPVg&s=19) shared their favorite use fo ChatGPT, which is to translate code from one language to another.
