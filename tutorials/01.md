## Generative AI Landscape
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly integrated into our daily lives, moving from the realm of science fiction to an omnipresent reality. A prime example of this phenomenon is the remarkable ascent of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, which reached 100 million households within a few monthsâ€”a feat that traditional landline telephones took 75 years to achieve.

The generative AI landscape has exploded globally over the past couple of years. It is impossible to calculate the exact number of total AI applications on the market, but some sites estimate the figure at hundreds to thousands daily.

## AI Tools on the Market
We are flooded online with hundreds, if not thousands, of AI tools daily. Luckily, there are several efforts to map the AI tools market, such as the [blog and database from ClickUp](https://clickup.com/blog/ai-tools/) which is frequently updated.

Based on [Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/explore/artificial-intelligence-startups-in-united-states/__8hhT66RA16YeZhW3QByF6cGkAjrM6ertfKJuKbQIiJg/companies), there are an estimated 18,563 AI startups in the United States.

## AI Models for Research and Software Development
Sometimes the terms artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are used interchangeably, but they do have their distinctions. For the sake of brevity:

* AI empcompasses ML and DL
* ML is a subset of AI
* DL is a further subset of ML

The current trends in AI research and applications all build on decades of research. It would be impossible to adequately cover the numerous types of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning models. Below is a roadmap of the ML history which has led to today's GPT and BERT applications.

A [blogpost from NVIDIA](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/13/what-are-foundation-models/) describes the ***foundation model*** is considered a "paradigm for building AI systems" since these AI neural networks are trained on massive unlabeled datasets and applicable across a variety of tasks. The figure below (from a [214-page collaborative paper from Stanford](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)) does a good job at illustrating this:

A year after the term "foundation models" was coined, another term ***"generative AI"*** also emerged as an umbrella broadly covering for transformers, large language models, diffusion models, and other neural networks which can create a wide range of content from text, images, video, code, and even music.

We will not elaborate on the current state of large language models, but [this site](https://lifearchitect.ai/models/) provides a fairly comprehensive summary for those interested in learning more. Some of the topics covered:
* Language model sizes & predictions
* Emergent abilities of LLMs
* Several industry models from Google, Meta, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.

Also included is an up-to-date [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878) summarizing details about current large language models.
