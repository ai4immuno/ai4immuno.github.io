## AI-Assisted Pair Programming
Within this module, we cover several ways in which immunologists can integrate AI into their programming workflow. We highlight the distinction between interacting with AI chatbots within internet browsers compared to AI-assisted pair programming within interactive development environments (IDE). 

There are numerous options for new modes of programming, including but not limited to: no code development and AI-assisted development. The former provides interactive interfaces which allow users to build websites and applications without writing any code, while the latter incorporates features such as predictive code completion and active debugging assistance.

## GitHub Copilot
https://github.com/features/copilot 


https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot

* Free 30 day trial
* Pricing
    * Individual accounts are $10/mo or $100/yr
    * Business accounts on enterprise GitHub, $19/user/mo
    * A free subscription for GitHub Copilot is available to verified students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open-source repositories on GitHub
        * Students can apply for free access via GitHub Student Developer Pack but might work for any .edu email

### VSCode 
Perk of VScode application is being able to sign into HPC/server directly from the same place you write all your other code

## ChaptGPT API Developer Key
* More on [OpenAI's pricing tiers](https://openai.com/pricing )
* ChatGPT API and ChatGPT Plus subscription are billed separately
    * The API has its own pricing. Basically gives you a developer API key to use in other places where you're actively developing an app or need GPT integrated into your working environment
    * You can start at $5 credit and cap the costs for small-time development & testing the waters
* Price per token - You can think of tokens as pieces of words used for natural language processing. For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words
* GPT-4, With broad general knowledge and domain expertise, GPT-4 can follow complex instructions in natural language and solve difficult problems with accuracy.
    * 8K context and 32K context have different pricing
* GPT-3.5Turbo, Optimized for dialogue
    * 4K context and 16K context are priced differently too
* Other models available -
    * Fine-tuning models (Ada, Babbage, Curie, Davinci)
    * Embedding models (Ada V2)
    * Image Models (build DALL-E directly into your models)
    * Audio models (whisper can transcribe speech to text and translate languages)


## Microsoft BioGPT
BioGPT, a domain-specific generative model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature, has achieved human parity, outperformed other general and scientific LLMs, and could empower biologists in various scenarios of scientific discovery.

An online user set up a [playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kadirnar/BioGpt) on HuggingFace where you can enter some text (a prompt) and the model will continue the text based on data from biomedical literature.

## AutoGPT
check out AutoGPT - still experimental but I think is the next progression of chatGPT. Difference is it uses GPT-4, has access to the internet (which this alone is a game changer), has the ability to execute code (meaning it can keep reiterating code until it get its right), has plugins for imaging as well as speech-to-txt / txt-to-speech, and lastly can run indefinitely if you would like it to.
