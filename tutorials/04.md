## Microsoft BioGPT
BioGPT, a domain-specific generative model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature, has achieved human parity, outperformed other general and scientific LLMs, and could empower biologists in various scenarios of scientific discovery.

An online user set up a [playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kadirnar/BioGpt) on HuggingFace where you can enter some text (a prompt) and the model will continue the text based on data from biomedical literature.

## AutoGPT
check out AutoGPT - still experimental but I think is the next progression of chatGPT. Difference is it uses GPT-4, has access to the internet (which this alone is a game changer), has the ability to execute code (meaning it can keep reiterating code until it get its right), has plugins for imaging as well as speech-to-txt / txt-to-speech, and lastly can run indefinitely if you would like it to.
