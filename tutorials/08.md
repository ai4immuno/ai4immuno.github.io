### Jane the Immunology Knowledge Assistant
Here is an awesome example of an AI application in immunology called ["Jane: the Immunology Knowledge Assistant"](https://rdilip-janewayq-a-main-rfx7el.streamlit.app/#jane-the-immunology-knowledge-assistant). A large language model was fed Janeway's Immunobiology textbook plus the OMAPs from the Human Reference Atlas. We couldn't find the creator of this AI tool, but would love to credit them!

## AI in Biology Demos on HuggingFace
[@katieelink on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/katieelink/status/1701637143330971837?s=20) shared a collection of [AI in Biology demos](https://huggingface.co/collections/hf4h/ai-in-biology-demos-65007d936a230e55a66cd31e) hosted on HuggingFace. Each of the demos leads to a playground space where users can click around and give each application a try.
