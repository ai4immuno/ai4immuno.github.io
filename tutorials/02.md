## Recommended Tools for Academic Researchers

### ChatBots
* OpenAI ChatGPT
* Google's Bard
* Microsoft Bing Chat
* Elicit - “AI research assistant” that you can have “intelligent conversations” and brainstorming with
    * Apparently it has a very knowledgeable and verified source
    * The software can also find relevant papers without perfect keyword matches, summarize them, and extract key information.
* ChatPDF - Upload paper PDFs, get short summary of paper, get examples of questions that could be answered on the full article, start asking it questions

### Literature Review*
* Scite.AI Assistant - Helps you find, read, and understand scientific literature
* SciSpace - Supposedly helps you with manuscript submission, peer-review, and publication process
* Research Rabbit - FREE site that “fast-tracks” your literature reviews; called the “Spotify of research” which allow users to add papers to “collections” so the recommender system can learn the user’s interests 
    * Also has a feature for graph/network visualizations of papers and co-authors

### Academic Community Consensus
* Consensus - “If ChatGPT and Google Scholar got married, their child would be Consensus”
Consensus looks like most search engines but what sets it apart is that you ask Yes/No questions, to which it provides answers with the consensus of the academic community.
