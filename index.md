## Why AI for Immunology?
Immunology is everywhere. As a discipline, the domain is an expansive and intricate tapestry that spans multiple biological scales. From protein expression, cytokine signaling, and single-cell interactions all the way up to tissue organization across multiple organs in complex systems. Immunology is uniquely positioned for transformation through AI because of its inherent complexity and richness.

We hope this resource site serves as a warm welcome for scientists of all backgrounds who are curious about using AI for their own research practices!

## Spanning Multiple Scales of Biology
One striking aspect of immunology is its sheer breadth and complexity. It's virtually impossible for a single immunologist to become an expert in every model system, immune cell type, immune-related disease setting from cancer to autoimmunity, pathogen type (encompassing viruses, parasites, bacteria, fungi), and to comprehend the diverse ways these diseases manifest in various phenotypes and symptoms.

## We're Rich! (In Data and Knowledge)
Immunology stands as a discipline uniquely enriched by vast repositories of big data, thanks to a multitude of advanced molecular and next-generation single-cell technologies. 

Immunologists employ a diverse array of bench techniques to interrogate biological and disease interactions at high resolution, from cutting-edge gene editing to multi-generational murine breeding and cell line engineering.

These cutting-edge tools, such as various flavors of cytometry, enable researchers to dissect the intricacies of the immune system at unprecedented levels of granularity. In addition, new technologies, like multi-color imaging techniques and high-throughput sequencing, each demand their own pipelines.  

The rich tapestry of data extends from the molecular interactions within individual cells to the broader systems-level understanding of immune responses across various tissues and organs. This immense data landscape, brimming with intricate biological details, makes immunology an ideal candidate for AI-driven solutions to decipher complex patterns, extract meaningful insights, and accelerate scientific discovery.

## Translating Bench to Bedside and Back

Immunology's prominence in the medical landscape is unmistakable, with a significant portion of FDA drug approvals in 2022 relating to immunology. The scale of both challenges and potential applications in immunology is growing exponentially, positioning it as the frontier where AI's capabilities can shine.

However, this endeavor is not without its challenges. Basic researchers and clinicians sometimes employ the same terminology, albeit coded with different meanings. The complexities of translating clinical observations into research questions (and vice versa), navigating the vast diversity of clinical phenotypes, and bridging disciplinary languages all pose significant hurdles.

## The Promise of AI for Computational & Systems Immunology
We recognized the vastness of intellectual real estate in immunology and the overwhelming speed of AI advancement. Because of this pressure to keep up with AI tools and research, we created this website to pool resources for the community.

Immunology experts possess a profound grasp of existing gaps, technical data limitations, biological variations, and research challenges. We hope this resource hub makes it easier for scientists to navigate the AI landscape for their own domain-specific applications.
