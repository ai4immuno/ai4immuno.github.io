## Overview
Generative AI is at the center of many heated debates across almost every domain, especially within the art world. There are many questions about the training and/or input data used to power these models and whether creators' consent is involved. While some individuals consider AI to replace human creators altogether, many others think of AI as an additional tool. We have gathered a handful of popular AI art applications for you to explore this balance for yourself. 

## Use With Caution
As enticing as it sounds to be able to generate dozens of "new" designs on the fly based on input text, there are considerable limitations of generative art tools. The end result is not always what a user has in mind. Many have a difficult time spelling out exact words and each software has its own stylistic choices which derive from the body of data available for training each model.

## Generative Art Tools
Below are two browser-accessible generative art applications. Here, we showcase the output differences when given the same prompt:

### *DALL-E via Bing Create, [bing.com/images/create](bing.com/images/create)
<br>This option is currently free to use and appears to have a token limit, which "boosts" the speed of image generation for each query.

## Over 150 Generative Art Tools
<br>The OpenTools website has curated a [list of over 150 generative art tools](https://opentools.ai/category/generative-art) which are currently available. Each may have different pricing models or availability. 


## AI Artists and Creators
<br>Countless artists have been creating generative AI art for years before the release of widely available software to the public. Artworks made with AI have reached one of the highest levels of exhibition in the art world, New York's Museum of Modern Art.
