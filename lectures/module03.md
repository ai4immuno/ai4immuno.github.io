    * OpenAI ChatGPT
    * Google's Bard
    * Microsoft Bing Chat
    * Elicit - “AI research assistant” that you can have “intelligent conversations” and brainstorming with
        * Apparently it has a very knowledgeable and verified source
        * The software can also find relevant papers without perfect keyword matches, summarise them and extract key information.
    * ChatPDF - Upload paper PDFs, get short summary of paper, get examples of questions that could be answered on the full article, start asking it questions
* Literature Review
    * Scite.AI Assistant - Helps you find, read, and understand scientific literature
    * SciSpace - Supposedly helps you with manuscript submission, peer-review, and publication process
    * Research Rabbit - FREE site that “fast-tracks” your literature reviews; called the “Spotify of research” which allow users to add papers to “collections” so the recommender system can learn the user’s interests 
        * Also has a feature for graph/network visualizations of papers and co-authors
* Academic Community Consensus
    * Consensus - “If ChatGPT and Google Scholar got married, their child would be Consensus”
    Consensus looks like most search engines but what sets it apart is that you ask Yes/No questions, to which it provides answers with the consensus of the academic community.
