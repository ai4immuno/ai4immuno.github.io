## Why AI for Immunology?
While fields like computational biology, genomics, and cheminformatics have made substantial strides in establishing robust computing frameworks over decades, one domain stands out as uniquely positioned for transformation through AI: computational immunology.

Immunology, as a discipline, is an expansive and intricate tapestry that spans multiple biological scales. It encompasses the minute details of protein interactions, cytokine signaling, and single-cell behaviors while extending to complex systems across multiple organs. Moreover, it operates across a wide spectrum of model systems, some of which, like mice, do not always possess direct counterparts or orthologs in humans. Immunologists employ a diverse array of bench techniques to interrogate biological and disease interactions at high resolution, from cutting-edge gene editing to multi-generational breeding and cell line engineering.

## Immunology Spans Multiple Scales of Biology
One striking aspect of immunology is its sheer breadth and complexity. It's virtually impossible for a single immunologist to become an expert in every model system, immune cell type, immune-related disease setting from cancer to autoimmunity, pathogen type (encompassing viruses, parasites, bacteria, fungi), and to comprehend the diverse ways these diseases manifest in various phenotypes and symptoms.

## Immunology is a Huge Player in Drug Approvals
Immunology's prominence in the medical landscape is unmistakable, with a significant portion of FDA drug approvals in 2022 relating to immunology. The scale of both challenges and potential applications in immunology is growing exponentially, positioning it as the frontier where AI's capabilities can shine.

## Translating Bench to Bedside and Back
However, this endeavor is not without its challenges. The complexities of translating clinical observations into research questions (and vice versa), navigating the vast diversity of clinical phenotypes, and bridging the communication gap between basic researchers and clinicians who sometimes employ the same terminology yet coded with different meanings all pose significant hurdles.

## We're Rich! (In Datasets)
Immunology stands as a discipline uniquely enriched by vast repositories of big data, thanks to a multitude of advanced molecular and next-generation single-cell technologies. These cutting-edge tools, ranging from flow cytometry, spectral cytometry, to mass cytometry (CyTOF), enable researchers to dissect the intricate intricacies of the immune system at unprecedented levels of granularity. In addition, multi-color imaging techniques and high-throughput sequencing technologies have further augmented the data deluge in immunology. 

The rich tapestry of data extends from the molecular interactions within individual cells to the broader systems-level understanding of immune responses across various tissues and organs. This immense data landscape, brimming with intricate biological details, makes immunology an ideal candidate for AI-driven solutions to decipher complex patterns, extract meaningful insights, and accelerate scientific discovery.


## The Promise of AI for Computational & Systems Immunology
Recognizing the vastness of intellectual real estate in immunology and the emergence of AI as well, we created this website to pool resources for immunologists from diverse backgrounds. 

By aggregating resources and fostering collaboration, immunologists can collectively contribute to the development of robust computing infrastructure and the creation of domain-specific applications. These endeavors leverage the unique understanding that immunology experts possessâ€”a profound grasp of existing gaps, technical data limitations, biological variations, and research challenges. Through these collaborative efforts, we aim to harness the full potential of AI for computational and systems immunology, facilitating advancements that only those deeply rooted in the field can achieve.
